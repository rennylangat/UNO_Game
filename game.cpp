//In a two-player game, the Reverse has the same effect as a Skip, allowing the player who discards it to take another turn

Draw-2 : next player draws 2 and loses a turn 
SKIP: next player loses turn (+2 instead of plus one)

WILD: choose a color
Draw-3 WILD: choose a color, next player draws 4 and loses a turn
