This is a C++ version of the Uno card game. 
Creator: Com L. (Summer 2015) 
The rules are the same as the acutal card game, but
you must declare uno as you play your second to last card. 
Meaning if you have two cards left, during you turn you 
will have to pick a card and declare uno i.e. >> 1 uno 
Have fun playing the game :)
